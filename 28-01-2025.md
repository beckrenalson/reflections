# Day 4 @ Take2
Today I created a simple website with a menu. This taught me how to create a table element and display different levels of headlines. Also added comments to the site, this helps other delevopers editing the source code understand the original writers intentions and also helps the writer remember what they have done or want to do in the future.
I learnt about escape codes and when to use them.
