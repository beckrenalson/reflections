Today I did more styling edits on my github.io page. I am starting to better understand about hexadecimal notation, how it is converted to decimal and vice versa. I have learnt how hex correlates to rgb to assign colors in CSS. I also leant about different CSS units eg. px, pt, em, and rem, and how these values define abosolute or relative lengths.
