I desided to design a print shop website where users will be able to browse artwork and also upload their own to the site. This will then be formatted onto a selected frame and shown in a room mockup. In the future I want to add options to purchase the artwork.

I started by creating a navigation bar, footer and added stock images with a basic "add to cart" button 
I looked into implementing CSS flexbox to create a container for the products, am having trouble figuring out placement of objects on the site but having some success with device resizing/ media scaling.
