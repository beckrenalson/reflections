# Day 8 @ Take2

Today I learnt about sigmoid and how it applies to our work/life choices. Life is unpridictable and more often than not will present new opportunities and paths to take. In any new venture there will be a bumpy start and as you progress, the more effort and time put in will expand your abilities in the given field, until eventually there will either not be anything new or exciting to learn or you will become bored. It will be time to start a new career or take up study. This can often be quite a daunting experience as what you have know for so long will be put on pause and the process of starting all over  will happen again, though the things you learnt in your previous job and throughout life, you can bring into your new line of work. 
Also did some work on Atomic Habits. Learnt about the Two-Minute Rule and added it to my website.
