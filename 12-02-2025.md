# Day 10 @ Take2

Today I completed a bonus exercise for week 4. This consisted of recreating the Google Search bar to pretty much exactly the same. This incorperated the weeks learning of creating forms, more specificly input fields and styling it accordingly with respective icons etc. Continued delevoping my github.io page trying to figure out different grid methods e.g. flexbox/css grid. We had a great workshop hosted by Sean talking about his life and mindfulness, vulnerability, and values.
